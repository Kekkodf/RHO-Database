\section{Interviews}
%who are we going to interview in order to obtain the proper information on the system?
%do we interview the final user? the managers? the analysts?
We conducted several interviews to understand the system requirements in detail:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The doctors: they clarified how they welcome the patients during the first visit and the kind of information they need to register. They examine their health status and document the patients' information, both anagraphical and first-stage medical analysis, e.g., blood pressure and heartbeat.
    \item The researchers (clinical engineers and data scientists): RHO's researchers described all the steps of the research pipeline. They explained that biological samples arrive at the RHO's research labs after the medical consultations and need to be properly handled, i.e., stored in \emph{ad hoc} refrigerators and boxes, before the clinical study. After the clinical studies, the results of the analyses need to be properly reported and made accessible for statistical purposes carried out by the Data Scientist at RHO's research labs. 
    \item The Information Technology (IT) technicians: the IT team of RHO explained that they are currently managing all the steps of this process using paper tables, and they have no infrastructure ready, except the hardware systems.
